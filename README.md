## Lambda Tutorial

A set of exercises to teach use of Java 8 lambda syntax, and the new Streams API.

To follow the exercises:

 - fork and clone the repository
 - ensure you have a correctly configured, lambda-enabled Java build
   - Maven can help generate configuration for your favourite IDE, though you will likely have to set the JDK manually
   - ensure your cloned project, particularly the class `ConfigureYourLambdaBuildOfJdk` compiles and runs correctly
 - navigate to the first exercise, `Exercise_1_Test` (tests are in src/test/java, in the package org.adoptopenjdk.lambda.tutorial)
 - read background information in the JavaDoc, and follow instructions, making the test pass
